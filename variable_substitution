--- # Testing how variable work in the vars section of a playbook
- hosts: '{{ myhosts }}'
  remote_user: ansible
  become: yes
  become_method: sudo 
  connection: ssh
  gather_facts: '{{ gather }}'
  vars: 
    myhosts: centos
    gather: yes
    pkg: telnet
  tasks:
  - name: Install the indicated software
    yum:
      name: '{{ pkg }}'
      state: latest

now you can pass in variable to the above playbook by:
ansible-playbook blabla.yml --extra-vars "myhosts=centos gather=yes pkg=telnet"
